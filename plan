Adding extra information on pages
Home:
Many families are affected by the pandemic. Children are not learning as well in school because they do not have many practicing resources, and parents are wondering when vaccines are available for them so they can send their children back to school. We created this website to try to solve both of these problems. Click "vaccines" to find available vaccines near you, information on that vaccine, and where to get it. Click "math practice" for some randomly generated arithmetic and factoring problems, and some preset algebra problems for practice.

Math Practice:
You can practice either arithmetic, factoring, or some algebra. The arithmetic problems are given to you based on difficulty, which increases as you get more problems correct. Even if you decide to leave the page, your difficulty will be saved. To reset your difficulty, clear your cookies. The factoring problems are also random, but not based on difficulty. The algebra problems are not random but preset, so you may see repeats.
