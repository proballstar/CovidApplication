## Inspiration


## What it does
It provides practice problems on math subjects such as arithmetic, factoring, and algebra to the children who need them. It also finds vaccine locations near your location to help parents find out when they can send their children back to school again.

## How we built it
We used Flask, a web framework written in Python. We also used an API to tell us which vaccine locations are available or not.

## Challenges we ran into
The API file was too large and we could not get much out of it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our random expression generator for the arithmetic practice.

## What we learned
- How to use Flask

## What's next for COVID Assist
Finding a better API for searching for vaccines.
